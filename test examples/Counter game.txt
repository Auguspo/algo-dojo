Louise and Richard play a game. They take turns to choose a number from the set {1, 2, 3, ...} and subtract the largest power of 2 less than the chosen number from it. If the number is not a power of 2, they reduce it by the largest power of 2 less than it. The game ends when the player to make a move that results in the number 1 wins.

Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.

Example:

Louise starts with n = 6. She determines that 6 is not a power of 2 and reduces it by the largest power of 2 less than it, so n = 6 - 4 = 2. Now it's Richard's turn. Since n = 2 is a power of 2, he divides it by 2, so n = 1. Richard wins the game.

Note: If they initially set the counter to 1, Richard wins since Louise cannot make a move.
